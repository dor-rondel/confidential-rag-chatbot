export const CUSTOM_SUMMARY_PROMPT = `
Your task is to progressively summarize a conversation. You must analyze the new lines of conversation in the context of the existing summary, and produce a new, updated summary.

Your summary should focus on identifying and tracking:
1. **Recurring Themes & Topics:** What are the main subjects being discussed?
2. **Key Entities & Pronouns:** Pay close attention to people, places, or concepts mentioned (e.g., "the user's document," "the AI's capabilities").
3. **Outliers & Extreme Statements:** If a statement is particularly unusual, surprising, or emotionally charged compared to the rest of the conversation, make sure to include a note of it.

EXAMPLE
Current summary:
The user is asking about the AI's capabilities.

New lines of conversation:
Human: Can you handle massive files? Like, a 10GB text file?
AI: My current architecture has some limitations, but I can process very large documents. However, a 10GB file would be a challenge and likely cause a crash. I absolutely cannot handle that.

New summary:
The user is asking about the AI's capabilities, specifically regarding file size limits. The AI has stated it can handle large documents but explicitly noted that a 10GB file is beyond its current capacity and would be considered an extreme case that could cause a crash.
